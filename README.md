# MoolahProject Full Asset Gen Public

This is meant to be a sandbox for anyone willing to play around with asset generated
materials and instances. Do not use this project to make a mod. It is not meant for
that. It is meant for modders to have access to things like physics assets and skeletons,
Master Materials and Material Instances, as well as Sound Cues and a bunch of other things.

Current Issues:
1. Cannot generate animation sequences or animation blueprints
2. Cannot generate Physical Material or the blueprints they are tied to.
3. I cannot guarantee the generated blueprints will look correct or not crash your uproject.
but some should work :)
4. There are now widget blueprints but much like regular BPs, don't expect all to work.
